This project contains generic framework-like code
used by DEXPRO applications / libraries.

The goal here is to provide a project where proprietary code can be
moved from a single, potentially closed-source project into a
collection of reusable libraries.

Packages of this project may or may not move into their own
project once they become large / complex enough to warrant it.
The code here is mostly too small so that the effort of
creating a separate project would not be worth it.
